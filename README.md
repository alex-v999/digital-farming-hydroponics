**Digital Farming** is a C# based application for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing hydroponic farm setups. Designed to help growers automate processes, collect data, and make better decisions.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time sensor monitoring (e.g. pH, EC, temperature, humidity, etc)  
- Automated actuation (pumps, lighting, vents)  
- Data logging and trend graphs  
- Alerts / thresholds (e.g. when readings exceed safe bounds)  
- Manual override and control interface
